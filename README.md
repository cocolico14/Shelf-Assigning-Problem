## Documentation

  -Tree and Node Class:
      - Making Tree Data Structure for Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing
      - String[] items is the initial state given in input
      - ArrayList<Node> is arraylist of children made in addChildren method
      - addChildren(int n) method in Node Class:
        - making n number of nodes and each node is splited items into different shelfs randomly and randomize order of each             item in shelfs
